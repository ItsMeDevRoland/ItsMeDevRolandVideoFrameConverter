# ItsMeDevRolandVideoFrameConverter
Convert Your Videos into Frame By Frame Png's... Useful for Rotoscoping

# Abstract
Rotoscoping is a traditional animation technique that involves tracing over motion picture footage, frame by frame, to create realistic movement. While modern software such as Blender and other 3D modeling tools have made rotoscoping more accessible, many animators in developing countries face significant challenges due to limited computational power. This inadequacy restricts their ability to utilize advanced animation software effectively. In Leau of this, I Am to Provide A Much easier and Lightweight Way of Using Rotoscoping, without the Ineffecientcy of Using Blender Or Other Program, and Using a Pure and Easy to Modify Programming Language, Python [please refer to this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping)

### My Software Aims to:
- Support Any Computer(Either Low-End or High-end)
- Easily Maintanability
- Provide Framework for future Softwares
- Use Low Resources for conversion
- Support AMD and Other Graphics and Computational

### What we Currently Have:
- Minimal UI
- Splashscreen
- Working Conversion support for ".gif, .mp4, .mov and .avi" to ".jpg, .png and .webp"
- Utilization of CUDA - Beta: [Learn More](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-cuda-2/)
- Debugger For Processing - Enable through Advance Menu

### Current Issues
- Untested OpenCL And TensorRL support
- Broken Dark and Light Mode: WIP
- High Loading Time: Possibly Caused By Python

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Install Python 3/Ensure Python is Installed And Is 3.+
2. Open Command Prompt and install pillow and Tkinter.
## Install through CMD ##
> - pip install opencv-python pillow
> - pip install tk
----
3. Download the video-frame-converter.py
4. Run video-frame-converter.py using Python
